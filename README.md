# 🗺️ Map Whisperer  
**No more “where should we go?”**

Map Whisperer helps you actually *use* your saved Google Maps places. Instead of endlessly scrolling through saved lists, you can filter them or just ask what you’re looking for — and get smart, ranked recommendations that make sense.

## 🧠 Inspiration

I’ve always struggled with deciding where to go from my saved places on Google Maps, especially when choosing somewhere to eat. You can save tons of places, but Google Maps only lets you sort them by name or date added. There’s no real way to filter, interact with, or get recommendations from them. That frustration led to the idea for Map Whisperer.

## ✨ What Map Whisperer Does

Map Whisperer turns your saved Google Maps places into something you can actually use.

- Import your saved places from Google Maps
- Use **filters** (like cuisine, price, or vibe) to narrow things down
- Or **chat naturally** to describe what you’re looking for
- The app understands your request, enriches your saved places with extra details, and returns a short, ranked list of recommendations
- No more decision fatigue, no more endless scrolling

## 💬 How It Works

1. Export your saved places from Google Maps (via Google Takeout)
2. Upload the file into Map Whisperer
3. Either:
   - apply filters, or  
   - chat with the app to describe what you want
4. Map Whisperer:
   - searches through your saved places
   - enriches them with additional context
   - ranks and explains the best matches
